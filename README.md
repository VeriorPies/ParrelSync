![UPM_Image](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync/raw/main/Images/UPM_1.png?raw=true) ![UPM_Image2](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync/raw/main/Images/UPM_2.png?raw=true)
  
or by adding 

```
"com.veriorpies.parrelsync": "https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync.git?path=/ParrelSync"
``` 

to the `Packages/manifest.json` file 


## Supported Platform
Currently, ParrelSync supports Windows and macOS editors.  
For Linux support, please download the [latest 1.4.2 beta release](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync/releases/tag/1.4.2).  

ParrelSync has been tested with the following Unity version. However, it should also work with other versions as well.
* *2020.1.2f1*
* *2019.3.0f6*
* *2018.4.22f1*


## APIs
There's some useful APIs for speeding up the multiplayer testing workflow.
Here's a basic example: 
```
if (ClonesManager.IsClone()) {
  // Automatically connect to local host if this is the clone editor
}else{
  // Automatically start server if this is the original editor
}
```
Check out [the doc](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync/wiki/List-of-APIs) to view the complete API list.

## How does it work?
For each clone instance, ParrelSync will make a copy of the original project folder and reference the ```Asset```, ```Packages``` and ```ProjectSettings``` folder back to the original project with [symbolic link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink). Other folders such as ```Library```, ```Temp```, and ```obj``` will remain independent for each clone project.

All clones are placed right next to the original project with suffix *```_clone_x```*, which will be something like this in the folder hierarchy. 
```
/ProjectName
/ProjectName_clone_0
/ProjectName_clone_1
...
```
